# go-alpha
While learning go, my kids are going to learn the alphabet

### Learning to Learn
So my son needs to learn and recongnize the letters in the US alphabet, and I want to learn go.  So matching the two at the same time makes the best sense to me.

### Help Wated

I definitely could use suggestions on best practice and just how to do this.
