# go-alpha
While learning go, my kids are going to learn the alphabet

### Learning to Learn
So my son needs to learn and recongnize the letters in the US alphabet, and I want to learn go.  So matching the two at the same time makes the best sense to me.

### Help Wated

I definitely could use suggestions (since I am new to Go) on best practice and just how to do this.


### What I will post
I will try to keep a log of everything; how I am doing, what I am doing, and any other one off items at twovi.com
